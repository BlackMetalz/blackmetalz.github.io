Here’s an extended list of **possible errors caused by misconfigurations in Ingress** (excluding the `404` errors). These are categorized based on the common issues that can occur with NGINX Ingress:

---

### 1. **502 Bad Gateway**
This error generally indicates that the Ingress Controller could not successfully connect to the backend service.

- **Backend Pods Are Not Ready:** If the backend service points to pods that are not ready or unhealthy (e.g., failing liveness or readiness probes), the Ingress Controller will fail to forward traffic.
- **No Endpoints Available for Service:** If the service has no endpoints (i.e., no matching pods for the selector), traffic cannot be routed.
- **Service Port Mismatch:** If the port defined in the Ingress spec does not match the service’s exposed port, the Ingress Controller cannot connect to the service.
- **Network Policies Blocking Traffic:** If network policies are restricting traffic between the Ingress Controller and the backend pods, requests may fail with a `502`.
- **Backend Timeout:** If the backend pods are slow to respond and exceed the default timeout of the Ingress Controller, you may get a `502`.

---

### 2. **503 Service Unavailable**
This typically happens when the Ingress Controller cannot find a route to the backend or if there are issues with TLS termination.

- **TLS Misconfiguration:**
  - If the TLS secret specified in the Ingress does not exist, or the secret does not contain valid certificate and key data, the Ingress Controller may return a `503`.
  - If the certificate does not match the requested hostname (common name mismatch), clients may reject the connection, leading to unavailability.
- **Ingress Controller Overload:**
  - If the NGINX Ingress Controller is under heavy load (e.g., CPU/Memory pressure), it may fail to handle requests, leading to a `503`.
- **Resource Limitations in the Backend:**
  - Backend services may run out of resources (e.g., CPU, memory), causing them to fail to handle traffic routed by the Ingress.

---

### 3. **SSL/TLS Configuration Errors**
SSL/TLS-related misconfigurations can cause problems with HTTPS traffic:

- **Missing TLS Certificate:** If the Ingress resource specifies `tls`, but no valid TLS secret is associated with the hostname, HTTPS traffic will fail.
- **Invalid TLS Certificate:** If the certificate in the TLS secret is invalid, expired, or incorrectly configured, the HTTPS connection will fail.
- **Untrusted Certificate Authority (CA):** If the certificate chain provided in the TLS secret is not signed by a trusted CA, clients may reject the connection.
- **TLS Redirect Loop:** Misconfigured annotations (e.g., `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/force-ssl-redirect`) may result in a redirect loop between HTTP and HTTPS.

---

### 4. **400 Bad Request**
This error typically arises due to client request issues, but it can also result from Ingress misconfigurations.

- **Incorrect Annotations for Request Size:** If the backend expects a large request body, and the annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size` is not set correctly, requests exceeding the default size (usually 1MB) will fail with a `400`.
- **Invalid Host Header:** If the client sends a malformed `Host` header or a header that does not match the Ingress `host` field, it may trigger a `400`.
- **Improper Client Authentication Configuration:** Misconfigurations in mutual TLS (mTLS) or client certificate validation may result in a `400` if the client does not provide the expected credentials.

---

### 5. **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Errors**
If your application involves APIs or frontend-backend communication, incorrect CORS configurations in the Ingress may cause issues.

- **Missing or Incorrect CORS Headers:** If the necessary annotations (e.g., `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/enable-cors`) or headers (e.g., `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`) are not configured, CORS errors may occur in browsers.
- **Wildcard CORS with Credentials:** If the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header is set to `*` but the application expects cookies or credentials, browsers will reject the response.

---

### 6. **Redirect/Rewrite Errors**
Issues with URL rewriting or redirection rules can cause unexpected behavior.

- **Improper Rewrite Annotations:**
  - For example, incorrect usage of `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target` can cause routing to break or unintended paths to be served.
- **Redirect Loop:** Misconfigured annotations like `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/force-ssl-redirect` or `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/permanent-redirect` can cause a redirect loop.
- **Missing Trailing Slash Handling:** If paths are expected to behave consistently with or without a trailing slash, but the rewrite rules do not account for this, errors may occur.

---

### 7. **Load Balancing Issues**
If your Ingress Controller uses load balancing features, misconfigurations can lead to uneven or incorrect traffic distribution.

- **Sticky Sessions Misconfigured:** If sticky sessions are required but not configured correctly (e.g., via `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/affinity`), session-based applications may behave unpredictably.
- **Incorrect Backend Weights:** If you configure custom weights for backends (via `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/upstream-hash-by`), but the configuration is wrong, traffic may not be balanced correctly.

---

### 8. **Health Check Failures**
Health checks between the Ingress Controller and backend pods can fail, causing traffic to be dropped.

- **Incorrect Health Check Path:** If `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol` or `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/health-check-path` is not configured correctly, the health checks may fail.
- **Custom Liveness/Readiness Probes Failing:** Backend pods may be marked as unavailable if custom probes are misconfigured.

---

### 9. **Header Manipulation Issues**
Ingress annotations often allow you to add, modify, or remove HTTP headers, but misconfigurations can lead to errors.

- **Missing Headers:** If the application depends on specific headers (e.g., `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Real-IP`), ensure they are correctly set using annotations like `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet`.
- **Overwriting Critical Headers:** Accidentally overwriting or misconfiguring headers like `Host`, `Authorization`, or `Cookie` may break application logic.

---

### 10. **Annotations Causing Conflicts**
Annotations are powerful but can conflict with each other or create unintended side effects.

- **Conflicting Annotations:** For example, using `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target` and `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex` together without proper regex patterns can lead to undefined behavior.
- **Deprecated Annotations:** Using outdated annotations that are no longer supported by the current NGINX Ingress Controller version can cause misconfigurations.
- **Missing Required Annotations:** Some setups (e.g., custom load balancer configurations) may require specific annotations, and missing them can cause failures.

---

### 11. **Ingress Resource Not Recognized**
If the Ingress resource is not processed by the Ingress Controller, it may cause issues.

- **Multiple Ingress Controllers:** If there are multiple Ingress Controllers in the cluster and the Ingress is not correctly assigned to a controller (via `ingressClassName`), it may not be recognized or processed.
- **Unsupported Features:** If the Ingress Controller does not support certain features or annotations (e.g., custom NGINX modules), the configuration may be ignored or fail.

---

### 12. **RBAC/Permissions Issues**
Access control misconfigurations can prevent the Ingress Controller from working properly.

- **Insufficient Permissions for Service Discovery:** The Ingress Controller needs permissions to list/watch services, endpoints, and secrets in the cluster. Misconfigured RBAC roles or bindings can break this.
- **Secret Access Denied:** If the Ingress Controller cannot access the TLS secret due to missing RBAC permissions, HTTPS traffic will fail.

---

### 13. **Ingress Controller Deployment Issues**
If the NGINX Ingress Controller itself is not properly configured, it can cause issues.

- **Misconfigured ConfigMap:** The NGINX Ingress Controller relies on a `ConfigMap` to configure global settings. Errors in this ConfigMap (e.g., invalid syntax) can cause the controller to crash or behave unpredictably.
- **Incorrect Service Type:** If the Ingress Controller is exposed as a `ClusterIP` instead of a `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer`, external traffic may not reach it.
