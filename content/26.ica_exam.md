# Istio Certified Associate (ICA) Overview

### 1. Service Mesh Fundamentals

Understanding the "Why" before the "How."

- **What is a Service Mesh:** A dedicated infrastructure layer for managing service-to-service communication in microservices architectures.
- **The Need for Istio:** Solving challenges like traffic management, security, and observability without modifying application code.
- **Sidecar vs. Ambient Mode:** Understanding the two deployment models — Sidecar (Envoy proxy per pod) vs. Ambient (ztunnel + waypoint proxies).

### 2. Istio Core Architecture

The backbone of the service mesh.

- **Control Plane (istiod):** The brain of Istio — handles configuration, certificate management, and service discovery.
- **Data Plane:** Envoy proxies that intercept and manage all network traffic between services.
- **Key Components:** All consolidated into `istiod` — handles traffic management (formerly Pilot), security/mTLS (formerly Citadel), and configuration validation (formerly Galley).


Example of **Traffic Flow**:

### 3. Installation, Upgrade & Configuration (20%)

Getting Istio up and running.

- **Installation Methods:** Using `istioctl install` or Helm charts.
- **Installation Profiles:** Understanding `default`, `demo`, `minimal`, and `ambient` profiles.
- **Customizing Installation:** Using IstioOperator resource for advanced configurations.
- **Upgrade Strategies:** Canary upgrades (run two control planes) vs. In-place upgrades.

### 4. Traffic Management (35%)

The largest exam domain — master this well.

- **Ingress & Egress:** Configuring Gateway resources for north-south traffic.
- **VirtualService:** Defining routing rules (host-based, header-based, URI matching).
- **DestinationRule:** Configuring load balancing policies, connection pools, and outlier detection.
- **Traffic Shifting:** Canary deployments and A/B testing with weighted routing.
- **Resilience Features:** Circuit breaking, retries, timeouts, and failover.
- **Fault Injection:** Testing resilience by injecting delays or HTTP errors.
- **ServiceEntry:** Connecting in-mesh workloads to external services.

### 5. Securing Workloads (25%)

Zero-trust security model.

- **Mutual TLS (mTLS):** Automatic encryption between services using PeerAuthentication.
- **Authorization Policies:** Fine-grained access control (allow/deny based on source, operation, conditions).
- **RequestAuthentication:** Validating JWT tokens at the mesh edge.
- **Securing Edge Traffic:** Configuring TLS termination and passthrough at the Ingress Gateway.

### 6. Troubleshooting (20%)

Debugging when things go wrong.

- **Configuration Issues:** Using `istioctl analyze` to detect misconfigurations.
- **Control Plane Debugging:** Checking istiod logs, sync status, and xDS configuration.
- **Data Plane Debugging:** Using `istioctl proxy-status`, `proxy-config`, and Envoy admin interface.
- **Common Issues:** 503 errors, mTLS conflicts, missing sidecars, and routing mismatches.

# Sections That Need to Be Understood

### 1. Sidecar vs. Ambient Mode
*Domain: Installation, Upgrade & Configuration*

Istio offers two data plane modes. Understanding the differences is crucial for the exam.

**Sidecar Mode (Traditional):**

![alt text](images/2025/12/37.png)

- Every pod gets its own Envoy proxy injected as a sidecar container.
- **Pros:** Full L7 features, mature and battle-tested.
- **Cons:** High resource overhead (memory/CPU per pod), increased latency.

**Ambient Mode (Sidecar-less):**

![alt text](images/2025/12/38.png)

- **ztunnel:** Node-level proxy handling L4 (TCP, mTLS).
- **Waypoint Proxy:** Optional L7 proxy deployed per namespace or service.
- **Pros:** Lower resource usage, simpler operations, no sidecar injection needed.
- **Cons:** Newer, some L7 features require waypoint deployment.

| Feature | Sidecar Mode | Ambient Mode |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| Resource overhead | High (per pod) | Low (per node) |
| L4 mTLS | Support | Support (ztunnel) |
| L7 features | Support (always) | Support (needs waypoint) |
| Injection required | Yes | No |
| Maturity | Stable | Newer (GA in 1.24+) |

### 2. VirtualService & DestinationRule Relationship
*Domain: Traffic Management*

These two resources work together and are the **most important concepts** for the exam.

**Resource Relationship:**

![alt text](images/2025/12/39.png)


**VirtualService — Defines WHERE traffic goes:**
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews-routing
spec:
  hosts:
    - reviews                          # Target service
  gateways:
    - mesh                             # For internal mesh traffic
    - bookinfo-gateway                 # For external traffic
  http:
    - match:
        - headers:
            end-user:
              exact: jason             # Header-based routing
      route:
        - destination:
            host: reviews
            subset: v2                 # Route to v2 for user "jason"
    - route:
        - destination:
            host: reviews
            subset: v1
          weight: 80                   # 80% to v1
        - destination:
            host: reviews
            subset: v3
          weight: 20                   # 20% to v3
```

**DestinationRule — Defines HOW traffic is handled:**
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: reviews-destination
spec:
  host: reviews                        # Must match VirtualService destination
  trafficPolicy:
    connectionPool:
      tcp:
        maxConnections: 100
      http:
        h2UpgradePolicy: UPGRADE
        http1MaxPendingRequests: 100
    loadBalancer:
      simple: ROUND_ROBIN              # ROUND_ROBIN, LEAST_CONN, RANDOM, PASSTHROUGH
    outlierDetection:
      consecutive5xxErrors: 5
      interval: 10s
      baseEjectionTime: 30s
  subsets:
    - name: v1
      labels:
        version: v1                    # Pod selector
    - name: v2
      labels:
        version: v2
      trafficPolicy:                   # Subset-specific policy
        loadBalancer:
          simple: LEAST_CONN
    - name: v3
      labels:
        version: v3
```

**Summary**:
```yaml
# DestinationRule define subset
subsets:
- name: v1
  labels:
    version: v1

# VirtualService route to that subset 
route:
- destination:
    host: my-svc
    subset: v1  # refer to DR
```

`VirtualService` and `DestinationRule` are namespace-scoped. But can be reference cross-namespace by FQDN `my-svc.other-namespace.svc.cluster.local` in `host` field!

> **Key Point:** VirtualService references subsets defined in DestinationRule. Always create DestinationRule **before** or **together with** VirtualService.

> - [DestinationRule](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/destination-rule/)

### 3. Gateway Configuration
*Domain: Traffic Management*

Gateway defines the entry/exit points for traffic entering or leaving the mesh.

**Ingress Gateway (North-South Traffic IN):**
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: bookinfo-gateway
spec:
  selector:
    istio: ingressgateway              # Use Istio's default ingress gateway
  servers:
    - port:
        number: 80
        name: http
        protocol: HTTP
      hosts:
        - "bookinfo.example.com"
    - port:
        number: 443
        name: https
        protocol: HTTPS
      hosts:
        - "bookinfo.example.com"
      tls:
        mode: SIMPLE                   # TLS termination
        credentialName: bookinfo-cert  # K8s secret with TLS cert
```

**TLS Modes:**

| Mode | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `SIMPLE` | TLS termination at gateway | Standard HTTPS |
| `MUTUAL` | mTLS - client cert required | High security |
| `PASSTHROUGH` | TLS passed to backend | Backend handles TLS |
| `ISTIO_MUTUAL` | Istio mTLS | Internal mesh traffic |

**Connect Gateway to VirtualService:**
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: bookinfo-vs
spec:
  hosts:
    - "bookinfo.example.com"
  gateways:
    - bookinfo-gateway                 # Reference the Gateway
  http:
    - route:
        - destination:
            host: productpage
            port:
              number: 9080
```


**Egress Gateway (North-South Traffic OUT):** Just need to memorize syntax, I will have a section explain this below with `ServiceEntry` and `VirtualService` with Egress Gateway together to see how it works!
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: istio-egressgateway
spec:
  selector:
    istio: egressgateway
  servers:
    - port:
        number: 443
        name: tls
        protocol: TLS
      hosts:
        - "external-api.example.com"
      tls:
        mode: PASSTHROUGH
```

### 4. Traffic Shifting & Canary Deployments
*Domain: Traffic Management*

Gradually shift traffic between service versions for safe deployments.

**Weighted Routing (Canary):**
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews
spec:
  hosts:
    - reviews
  http:
    - route:
        - destination:
            host: reviews
            subset: v1
          weight: 90                   # 90% to stable version
        - destination:
            host: reviews
            subset: v2
          weight: 10                   # 10% to canary version
```

**Header-Based Routing (A/B Testing):**
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews
spec:
  hosts:
    - reviews
  http:
    - match:
        - headers:
            x-canary:
              exact: "true"            # Route if header present
      route:
        - destination:
            host: reviews
            subset: v2
    - route:
        - destination:
            host: reviews
            subset: v1                 # Default route
```

**Traffic Mirroring (Shadow Traffic):**
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews
spec:
  hosts:
    - reviews
  http:
    - route:
        - destination:
            host: reviews
            subset: v1
      mirror:
        host: reviews
        subset: v2                     # Mirror traffic to v2
      mirrorPercentage:
        value: 100.0                   # Mirror 100% of traffic
```

> **Key Point:** Mirrored traffic is "fire and forget" — responses from the mirror are discarded.

### 5. mTLS & PeerAuthentication
*Domain: Securing Workloads*

Istio can automatically encrypt all service-to-service traffic using mutual TLS.

**PeerAuthentication Modes:**

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `STRICT` | Only mTLS traffic allowed (reject plaintext) |
| `PERMISSIVE` | Accept both mTLS and plaintext (migration mode) |
| `DISABLE` | Disable mTLS |
| `UNSET` | Inherit from parent scope |

**Scope Hierarchy:**

![alt text](images/2025/12/40.png)


**Mesh-wide STRICT mTLS:**
```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: istio-system              # istio-system = mesh-wide
spec:
  mtls:
    mode: STRICT
```

**Namespace-level mTLS:**
```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: production                # Applies to production namespace
spec:
  mtls:
    mode: STRICT
```

**Workload-level mTLS:** The guard decides to accept or reject traffic. With STRICT, it said: I only accept TLS, plaintext will get rejected! Not related to anything client-side!
```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata:
  name: reviews-mtls
  namespace: production
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: reviews                     # Only applies to reviews service
  mtls:
    mode: STRICT                       # All port requires mTLS
  portLevelMtls:
    8080:
      mode: PERMISSIVE                 # Port-specific override that allow both mTLS and plaintext
```

**DestinationRule TLS Settings (Client-side):**
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: reviews-mtls
spec:
  host: reviews
  trafficPolicy:
    tls:
      mode: ISTIO_MUTUAL               # Use Istio's mTLS
```

> **Key Point:** PeerAuthentication = server-side (what traffic to accept). DestinationRule tls = client-side (how to connect).

> **References:**

> - [PeerAuthentication](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/security/peer_authentication/)
> - [Mutual TLS Migration](https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/security/authentication/mtls-migration/)

---

### 6. AuthorizationPolicy
*Domain: Securing Workloads*

Fine-grained access control for workloads.

**Policy Actions:**

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `ALLOW` | Allow matching requests (default deny all others) |
| `DENY` | Deny matching requests |
| `CUSTOM` | Delegate to external authorizer |
| `AUDIT` | Audit matching requests (logging only) |

**Deny-All Policy (Zero Trust Baseline):**
```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
  name: deny-all
  namespace: production
spec:
  {}                                   # Empty spec = deny all
```

**Allow Specific Traffic:**
```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-productpage
  namespace: production
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: productpage
  action: ALLOW
  rules:
    - from:
        - source:
            principals: ["cluster.local/ns/production/sa/frontend"]
      to:
        - operation:
            methods: ["GET"]
            paths: ["/api/*"]
      when:
        - key: request.headers[x-token]
          values: ["valid-token"]
```

You will be thinking WTF is this? So I will start explain it now xD

`principals` is SPIFFE ID (A SPIFFE ID is a string that uniquely and specifically identifies a workload)

```
cluster.local/ns/production/sa/frontend
     │          │      │      │    │
     │          │      │      │    └── ServiceAccount name
     │          │      │      └── "sa" = service account
     │          │      └── Namespace name
     │          └── "ns" = namespace
     └── Trust domain (default cluster.local)
```

Read this rule by this following steps: Only allow request into pod `app: productpage` when

- from: client use serviceAccount `frontend` in namespace `production`
- to: Method `GET`, path `/api/*`
- when: Header `x-token: valid-token`

Those conditions are AND, if one not matching, then it will be denied.

Why use SPIFFE ID: because mTLS cert of each pod this identity, when traffic arrived, server sidecar extract identity from cert -> match with `principals`

Check identity của pod:
```yaml
istioctl proxy-config secret <pod> -o json | grep spiffe
```

Short forms for exam:
```yaml
principals: ["cluster.local/ns/production/sa/frontend"]  # exact SA
principals: ["cluster.local/ns/production/sa/*"]         # any SA in ns
namespaces: ["production"]                                # simpler, same ns check
```

**Deny Specific Traffic:**
```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
  name: deny-bad-ips
  namespace: production
spec:
  action: DENY
  rules:
    - from:
        - source:
            ipBlocks: ["10.0.0.0/8"] # Deny this
            notIpBlocks: ["10.0.1.0/24"] # But except this xD (whitelist)
```

**Policy Evaluation Order:**
```
1. CUSTOM policies (if any)
2. DENY policies (if match → reject)
3. ALLOW policies (if match → allow)
4. No match → depends on whether ALLOW policies exist
   - If ALLOW policies exist → deny (allowlist mode)
   - If no ALLOW policies → allow (no restriction)
```

### 7. RequestAuthentication (JWT Validation)
*Domain: Securing Workloads*

Validate JWT tokens at the mesh edge. `RequestAuthentication` validate JWT token

**Basic JWT Validation:**
```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: RequestAuthentication
metadata:
  name: jwt-auth
  namespace: production
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: productpage
  jwtRules:
    - issuer: "https://auth.example.com" # JWT must have iss claim equal to this!
      jwksUri: "https://auth.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json" # Endpoint get public keys to verify signature
      audiences: # JWT must have `aud` claim match
        - "bookinfo-app"
      forwardOriginalToken: true       # Forward JWT to upstream
      outputPayloadToHeader: x-jwt-payload # Decode payload -> send into header x-jwt-payload
```

**Multiple Issuers:**
```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: RequestAuthentication
metadata:
  name: multi-jwt
spec:
  jwtRules:
    - issuer: "https://accounts.google.com"
      jwksUri: "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/certs"
    - issuer: "https://auth0.example.com/"
      jwksUri: "https://auth0.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json"
```

**Combine with AuthorizationPolicy:** To enforce JWT, it must be combined with `AuthorizationPolicy`
```yaml
# First: Validate JWT
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: RequestAuthentication
metadata:
  name: jwt-auth
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: productpage
  jwtRules:
    - issuer: "https://auth.example.com"
      jwksUri: "https://auth.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json"
---
# Then: Require valid JWT
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
  name: require-jwt
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: productpage
  action: ALLOW
  rules:
    - from:
        - source:
            requestPrincipals: ["https://auth.example.com/*"] # Must have valid JWT
```

Exam Note: `RequestAuthentication` alone doesn't block requests not having JWT

- Have invalid JWT --> 401!
- Do not have JWT --> Still pass!

> **Key Point:** RequestAuthentication only **validates** tokens. To **require** tokens, combine with AuthorizationPolicy.

> **References:**

> - [RequestAuthentication](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/security/request_authentication/)
> - [JWT Auth](https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/security/authentication/authn-policy/#end-user-authentication)

### 8. Resilience Features
*Domain: Traffic Management*

Build fault-tolerant services with Istio's resilience features.

**Circuit Breaker (Connection Pool + Outlier Detection):**
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: reviews-cb
spec:
  host: reviews
  trafficPolicy:
    connectionPool:
      tcp:
        maxConnections: 100            # Max TCP connections
      http:
        http1MaxPendingRequests: 100   # Max pending HTTP/1.1 requests
        http2MaxRequests: 1000         # Max HTTP/2 requests
        maxRequestsPerConnection: 10   # Requests per connection
        maxRetries: 3                  # Max concurrent retries
    outlierDetection:
      consecutive5xxErrors: 5          # Eject after 5 consecutive 5xx
      interval: 10s                    # Analysis interval
      baseEjectionTime: 30s            # Min ejection time
      maxEjectionPercent: 50           # Max % of hosts to eject
      minHealthPercent: 30             # Min healthy hosts required
```

**Retries:**
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews
spec:
  hosts:
    - reviews
  http:
    - route:
        - destination:
            host: reviews
      retries:
        attempts: 3                    # Max retry attempts
        perTryTimeout: 2s              # Timeout per attempt
        retryOn: "5xx,reset,connect-failure"
        retryRemoteLocalities: true    # Retry on different locality
```

**Timeouts:**
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews
spec:
  hosts:
    - reviews
  http:
    - route:
        - destination:
            host: reviews
      timeout: 10s                     # Total request timeout
```

**Fault Injection (Testing Resilience):**
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews
spec:
  hosts:
    - reviews
  http:
    - fault:
        delay:

### 9. ServiceEntry & WorkloadEntry
*Domain: Traffic Management*

Connect mesh services to external services or VMs.

**ServiceEntry — Register External Services:**
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: ServiceEntry
metadata:
  name: external-api
spec:
  hosts:
    - api.external.com
  location: MESH_EXTERNAL              # Outside the mesh
  ports:
    - number: 443
      name: https
      protocol: TLS
  resolution: DNS                      # DNS, STATIC, or NONE
```

**ServiceEntry with Egress Gateway:**
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: ServiceEntry
metadata:
  name: external-api
spec:
  hosts:
    - api.external.com
  ports:
    - number: 443

### 10. Troubleshooting Commands
*Domain: Troubleshooting*

Essential `istioctl` commands for the exam.

**Installation & Verification:**
```bash
# Install Istio
istioctl install --set profile=demo -y

# Verify installation
istioctl verify-install

# Check Istio version
istioctl version

# View installation profile
istioctl profile dump demo
istioctl profile diff default demo
```

**Analyze Configuration:**
```bash
# Analyze entire mesh for issues
istioctl analyze

# Analyze specific namespace
istioctl analyze -n production

# Analyze specific file
istioctl analyze my-config.yaml

# Common issues detected:
# - IST0101: Referenced gateway not found
# - IST0102: Referenced host not found
# - IST0106: Schema validation error
```

**Proxy Status & Sync:**
```bash
# Check proxy sync status with control plane
istioctl proxy-status
# Output columns: NAME, CDS, LDS, EDS, RDS, ECDS, ISTIOD

# Status meanings:
# SYNCED - Config synced with control plane
# NOT SENT - Config not sent (usually no listeners)
# STALE - Config outdated

# Debug specific proxy
istioctl proxy-status <pod-name>.<namespace>
```

**Proxy Configuration:**
```bash
# View proxy configuration summary
istioctl proxy-config all <pod-name> -n <namespace>

# View specific config types
istioctl proxy-config routes <pod-name> -n <namespace>
istioctl proxy-config clusters <pod-name> -n <namespace>
istioctl proxy-config listeners <pod-name> -n <namespace>
istioctl proxy-config endpoints <pod-name> -n <namespace>
istioctl proxy-config secrets <pod-name> -n <namespace>

# Output as JSON for detailed analysis
istioctl proxy-config routes <pod-name> -o json

# Filter by service
istioctl proxy-config clusters <pod-name> --fqdn reviews.default.svc.cluster.local
```

**Debug & Logging:**
```bash
# Enable debug logging on proxy
istioctl proxy-config log <pod-name> --level debug

# Enable specific component logging
istioctl proxy-config log <pod-name> --level connection:debug,http:debug

# View Envoy access logs (in pod)
kubectl logs <pod-name> -c istio-proxy -f

# Describe proxy (detailed info)
istioctl experimental describe pod <pod-name>
```

**Dashboard & Visualization:**
```bash
# Open Kiali dashboard
istioctl dashboard kiali

# Open Grafana
istioctl dashboard grafana

# Open Jaeger (tracing)
istioctl dashboard jaeger

# Open Envoy admin interface
istioctl dashboard envoy <pod-name>

# Open Prometheus
istioctl dashboard prometheus

# Open istiod control plane
istioctl dashboard controlz <istiod-pod>
```

**Injection & Labeling:**
```bash
# Check if namespace has auto-injection enabled
kubectl get namespace -L istio-injection

# Enable auto-injection
kubectl label namespace <ns> istio-injection=enabled

# Disable auto-injection
kubectl label namespace <ns> istio-injection-

# Manual injection
istioctl kube-inject -f deployment.yaml | kubectl apply -f -

# Check injection status
istioctl experimental check-inject -n <namespace>
```

**Common Troubleshooting Scenarios:**

| Symptom | Command | What to Check |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| 503 errors | `istioctl proxy-config clusters` | Cluster health, endpoints |
| Routing not working | `istioctl proxy-config routes` | VirtualService applied correctly |
| Config not applied | `istioctl analyze` | Configuration errors |
| Sidecar not injected | `kubectl get pod -o yaml` | Injection labels |

### 11. Installation & Upgrade
*Domain: Installation, Upgrade & Configuration*

**Installation Profiles:**

| Profile | Use Case | Components |
|---------|----------|------------|
| `default` | Production | istiod, ingress gateway |
| `demo` | Learning/Testing | All components, high tracing |
| `minimal` | Control plane only | istiod only |
| `ambient` | Ambient mode | ztunnel, CNI |
| `empty` | Custom builds | Nothing (start from scratch) |

```bash
# List available profiles
istioctl profile list

# Show profile configuration
istioctl profile dump demo

# Compare profiles
istioctl profile diff default demo
```

**Installation Methods:**

```bash
# Method 1: istioctl (recommended)
istioctl install --set profile=demo -y

# Method 2: IstioOperator manifest
istioctl install -f my-istio-config.yaml

# Method 3: Helm
helm repo add istio https://istio-release.storage.googleapis.com/charts
helm install istio-base istio/base -n istio-system --create-namespace
helm install istiod istio/istiod -n istio-system
helm install istio-ingress istio/gateway -n istio-ingress --create-namespace
```

**IstioOperator Custom Configuration:**
```yaml
apiVersion: install.istio.io/v1alpha1
kind: IstioOperator
metadata:
  name: istio-control-plane
spec:
  profile: default
  meshConfig:
    accessLogFile: /dev/stdout         # Enable access logs
    enableTracing: true
    defaultConfig:
      tracing:
        sampling: 100.0                # 100% trace sampling
  components:
    ingressGateways:
      - name: istio-ingressgateway
        enabled: true
        k8s:
          service:
            type: LoadBalancer
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: 100m
              memory: 128Mi
    egressGateways:
      - name: istio-egressgateway
        enabled: true
  values:
    global:
      proxy:
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 50m
            memory: 64Mi
```

**Upgrade Strategies:**

**In-Place Upgrade:**
```bash
# Download new version
curl -L https://istio.io/downloadIstio | ISTIO_VERSION=1.22.0 sh -

# Upgrade
istioctl upgrade --set profile=default

# Restart workloads to get new sidecar
kubectl rollout restart deployment -n <namespace>
```

**Canary Upgrade (Recommended for Production):**
```bash
# Install new control plane with revision
istioctl install --set revision=1-22-0 --set profile=default

# Label namespace to use new revision
kubectl label namespace production istio.io/rev=1-22-0 --overwrite

# Restart workloads
kubectl rollout restart deployment -n production

# After validation, remove old control plane
istioctl uninstall --revision 1-21-0
```

# Key Resources

- [Istio Official Documentation](https://istio.io/latest/docs/)
- [ICA Exam Curriculum](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/istio-certified-associate-ica/)
- [Istio GitHub Examples](https://github.com/istio/istio/tree/master/samples)

# Honest Recommendation

- The ICA exam is **performance-based**, meaning you'll work on a real Kubernetes cluster with Istio installed. Hands-on practice is essential.
- Focus heavily on **Traffic Management (35%)** — it's the largest domain and covers VirtualService, DestinationRule, and Gateway configurations.
- Use `istioctl` commands extensively during practice — they're your best friend for both installation and troubleshooting.
- Read the official Istio docs multiple times. The exam questions are often directly based on concepts explained there.
- Practice the relationship between resources: Gateway → VirtualService → DestinationRule.

# My Secret Weapon: Mock Exam

After absorbing all the concepts above, there's one more crucial step before you're truly exam-ready: **practice with mock exams**.

Reading documentation and understanding concepts is essential, but the real test comes when you face actual exam-style questions under time pressure. Mock exams help you:

- **Identify knowledge gaps:** You might think you understand a topic until a tricky question proves otherwise.
- **Get familiar with question patterns:** The ICA exam has its own style of wording and question structure.
- **Build time management skills:** Knowing the content is one thing; answering questions while configuring resources in 2 hours is another.
- **Boost confidence:** Walking into the exam having already "passed" a similar test reduces anxiety significantly.
