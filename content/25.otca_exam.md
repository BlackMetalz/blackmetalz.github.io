# OpenTelemetry Certified Assocate (OTCA) overview

---

### 1. Observability Fundamentals

Understanding the "Why" before the "How."

- **The Three Pillars:** Deep dive into **Traces, Metrics, and Logs**.
- **The Need for OpenTelemetry:** Solving "Vendor Lock-in" and standardizing telemetry data collection.
- **Monitoring vs. Observability:** Understanding the difference between knowing "what" is happening vs. "why" it is happening.

### 2. OpenTelemetry Core Architecture

The backbone of the project.

- **The OTel Collector:** Understanding the data pipeline: **Receivers** (ingestion), **Processors** (transformation), and **Exporters** (destination).
- **OTLP (OpenTelemetry Protocol):** The unified protocol for delivering telemetry data.
- **Context Propagation:** How OTel maintains the "trace context" as requests move across different microservices (Baggage and Traceparent).

### 3. OpenTelemetry Specification

Key concepts and data models.

- **Resources:** Metadata describing the entity producing the telemetry (e.g., `service.name`, `host.id`).
- **Traces & Spans:** Understanding Span hierarchy, Span Events, and Span Attributes.
- **Metrics:** Learning about different instrument types: **Counter, Gauge, Histogram, and Summary**.
- **Logs:** How OTel bridges the gap with legacy logging systems.

### 4. Instrumentation Approaches

How to get data out of your applications.

- **Automatic Instrumentation:** Using Agents or SDKs to collect data without changing the application code (Zero-code approach).
- **Manual Instrumentation:** Using the **OpenTelemetry API** and **SDK** to manually define custom spans and metrics within the business logic.
- **API vs. SDK:** Understanding the distinction (API is for instrumentation; SDK is for configuration and processing).

### 5. Configuration & Deployment Patterns

Putting OTel into production.

- **Deployment Modes:** Difference between running the Collector as an **Agent** (Sidecar/DaemonSet) vs. a **Gateway** (Standalone service).
- **Collector Configuration:** Mastering the YAML structure (`extensions`, `receivers`, `processors`, `exporters`, and `service pipelines`).
- **Sampling:** Understanding **Head-based sampling** vs. **Tail-based sampling** to manage data volume and costs.

### 6. Ecosystem & Interoperability

- **CNCF Landscape:** OpenTelemetry’s role as a CNCF incubated project.
- **Compatibility:** How OTel interacts with other tools like **Prometheus**, **Jaeger**, **Zipkin**, and **Fluentd**.
- **Semantic Conventions:** The importance of standardized naming for attributes across different technologies.
