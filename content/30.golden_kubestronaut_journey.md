# The story

TLDR: The title is a lie xD, in fact, I have spent about total 45-50 days.

From the beginning, I never think I will go for full Golden Kubestronaut certifications, I just had interest in field of Platform Engineering after viewing a demo what its capabilities, then I was aiming for 2 certifications which are Certified Backstage Associate (CBA) and Certified Cloud Native Platform Engineer (CNPE), but somehow I started thinking about full complete Golden Kubestronaut, it was affected by the following conditions:

- Cyber Week Promo (50% discount on any exams)
- While scrolling through LinkedIn, one of my connections shared a certification in a bundle of Golden Kube, which gave me extra motivation xD
- I have no idea what I will do in December 2025. I want to keep myself busy instead of spending every free evening time for gaming, short videos, drama...
- I want a target with clarified objectives to be achieved

The last condition is the most important, I guess, because with clear and detailed input/output, it should be a good task or objective. So I set a board with a task list of how many exams I need to pass to achieve that Golden Kubestronaut cert!

# Progress for each exam

In the first week, I was really careful and serious, only scheduling after I felt confident about the exam. But from the second week, I was "YOLO" and forced my lazy ass to learn, just scheduled without preparing or feeling confident about the exam, haha.

### 01. Prometheus (PCA)
This is the exam that I underestimated, and I almost paid the price for being careless. I'm still thinking that this exam is easy. I have been working with Prometheus for a long time, and this should not be hard. But in fact, I didn't understand Prometheus well enough, like what the core metric types of Prometheus are, I'm not able to answer or explain that =.=!

### 02. Istio (ICA)
This is the second exam I failed to pass on the 1st try. My mistake was not checking the exam details carefully of the exam. I assumed this was quiz choices, and I only spent 1 day to prepare, and the result is failure for the 1st time for sure. Have to prepare and practice and lab, reschedule it for 3 days after 1st try!

### 03. Cilium (CCA)
This is the first exam I failed to pass on the 1st try. I failed because I didn't think the resource kind Gateway of K8S would appear in the exam (yeah, I'm a little outdated on K8S xD), and I was angry at myself.

### 04. Argo (CAPA)
Haha, I thought Argo Projects were just ArgoCD and Argo Rollouts before.

### 05. Gitops (CGOA)
This was easy to pass.

### 06. Backstage (CBA)
This is the first of the 2 certifications I did serious learning, which led to Golden Kubestronaut.

### 07. Opentelemetry (OTCA)
Opentelemetry is a vendor-neutral, tool for collecting telemetry data, including traces, metrics, and logs. I had fun with the basic traces and spans.

### 08. Kyverno (KCA)
This is good to learn, even though I haven't used this in the past (same for CKS, attempt for the mindset increment, not certification itself)

### 09. Platform Engineer (CNPA)
This is the second of the 2 certifications I did serious learning, which led to Golden Kubestronaut.

### 10. Linux Admin (LFCS)
I forgot some basics, this is a chance that forced me to re-learn xD
