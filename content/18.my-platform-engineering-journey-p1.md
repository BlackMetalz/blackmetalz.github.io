# My Platform Engineering Journey #1: The Beginning
It began with a Saturday morning coffee meeting with former colleagues. He demonstrated what he had been working on over the past three months, and I was truly amazed. He had built not just a user-friendly all-in-one portal, but specifically

- Ticket system: Tracks progress stages and involved personnel, with notifications
- Service section: Integrates everything internally - deployments, metrics, logs - eliminating the need for external Grafana dashboards
- Deployment: Standard templates allowing users to get endpoints/deployments with minimal clicks

That is my motivation come from, let's begin. My first resource as well this article: 
- [Introduction to Platform Engineering](https://www.udemy.com/course/introduction-to-platform-engineering/)
- [platformengineering.org](https://platformengineering.org/)
- [InternalDeveloperPlatform.org](InternalDeveloperPlatform.org)
- [Platform engineering vs DevOps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghzsBm8vOms)

# Let's talk about salary, career opportunities
- Most of the people will tell that Platform Engineer will have higher than salary than DevOps/SRE/CloudOps/Infrastructure engineers. But it will be the same result if you replace the word DevOps vs SRE/CloudOps/etc... xD. So what is the point? In my personal opinion, it depended on what you have built/able to build, not fancy certifications or beautiful resume/curriculum vitae (It is my personal opinion, I repeated xD)
- when I'm writing this article, I don't have much idea about career opportunities, I just like keyword Platform Engineering and what it's capability, that's all nothing more. And this will consume 6 months of mine to achieve the basic stuff I guess xD
