# My Platform Engineering Journey #1: The Beginning
It began with a Saturday morning coffee meeting with former colleagues. He demonstrated what he had been working on over the past three months, and I was truly amazed. He had built not just a user-friendly all-in-one portal, but specifically

- Ticket system: Tracks progress stages and involved personnel, with notifications
- Service section: Integrates everything internally - deployments, metrics, logs - eliminating the need for external Grafana dashboards
- Deployment: Standard templates allowing users to get endpoints/deployments with minimal clicks

That is my motivation come from, let's begin. My first resource as well this article: 
- [Introduction to Platform Engineering](https://www.udemy.com/course/introduction-to-platform-engineering/)
- [platformengineering.org](https://platformengineering.org/)
- [InternalDeveloperPlatform.org](InternalDeveloperPlatform.org)
- [Platform engineering vs DevOps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghzsBm8vOms)

# Let's talk about salary, career opportunities
- Most of the people will tell that Platform Engineer will have higher than salary than DevOps/SRE/CloudOps/Infrastructure engineers. But it will be the same result if you replace the word DevOps vs SRE/CloudOps/etc... xD. So what is the point? In my personal opinion, it depended on what you have built/able to build, not fancy certifications or beautiful resume/curriculum vitae (It is my personal opinion, I repeated xD)
- when I'm writing this article, I don't have much idea about career opportunities, I just like keyword Platform Engineering and what it's capability, that's all nothing more. And this will consume 6 months of mine to achieve the basic stuff I guess xD

# Let's learn about Platform Engineering

### Problems to be resolved - repeated DevOps tasks

First example, I'm currently working as DevOps Engineer role. I managed GitLab groups that have hundreds repositories and 50 repositories needed to be set with CI/CD (event rewrite Dockerfile to best practices!), monitoring and so on. When I begin to set up, first 10 repositories is completely fine, it costs about 3 hours (because they are all Go and Python). But from 11th repositories I have feeling that I'm doing repeated job and this is not the first time, before was Jenkins. So I'm starting to think is there any solution would allow me escaped from this bored task?

Second example, complicated for users (Developers):
- They need to remember which URL is for their application logs or how to query for their service.
- Which Grafana dashboard and query is correct for their service's metrics. 
- How to check their service status, is their pod get restarted by OOM or crashed, do they know the reason if they don't have access to K8s cluster?

A lot of stuff I have been reading, but only thing made me feel interest. That is Platform Engineering, after watch it's concepts, I think this is the key to solve problems I see in the past (In the past not only lack of experience, I also lack of knowledge!)

### What I know about Platform Engineering?
- It is based DevOps and allow DevOps scale, so it will not gonna replace DevOps!
- Centralized everything at 1 portal (portal is an interface in Platform Engineering)
- Build Internal Developer Platform (IDP) as integrated product, not another internal tools or project. And user is Developer. Make developer satisfied and happy are our job! 
- An Internal Developer Platform must be built as a **product** following product management best practices.
- Cover every operational necessities of entire lifecycle (services & applications).
- Automation & Standardization, Compliance, Governance & Security by design.

### Build IDP as a Product
